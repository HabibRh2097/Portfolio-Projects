# Habib Rahou - Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Habib! i have a masters degree in Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE), I spend most of my time in this post doing factory risk analytical work which lead to my eventual attachment to the field of analysis in general.
I am persuing my second degree in Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. to me Numbers tell stories and I can read those stories to you and turn complex data into simple, understandable structures. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my work as HSE and risk analysis engineer and as a Data analyst I honed my ability to work with data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. and In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
